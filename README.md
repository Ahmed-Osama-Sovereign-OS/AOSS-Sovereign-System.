AOSS: Ahmed Osama Sovereign Operating System

    The Vision: > A next-generation, offline-first system that merges Quantum Physics with AI logic. Designed to run independently of the global grid, creating a "Sovereign World" on local hardware.

    Key Architectures:

        Quantum Shield: Advanced encryption layer based on quantum randomness.

        Physics Core: Integration of relativity formulas to stabilize data processing at high velocities.

        Zero-Trace Execution: A kernel designed to leave no digital footprint on host hardware.

    Technical Stack: C++, Assembly, Physics-driven Algorithms
